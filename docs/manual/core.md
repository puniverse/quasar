## Fibers {#fibers}

Quasar's chief contribution is that of the lightweight thread, called *fiber* in Quasar.  
Fibers provide functionality similar to threads, and a similar API, but they're not managed by the OS. They are lightweight in terms of RAM (an idle fiber occupies ~400 bytes of RAM) and put a far lesser burden on the CPU when task-switching. You can have millions of fibers in an application. If you are familiar with Go, fibers are like goroutines. Fibers in Quasar are scheduled by one or more [ForkJoinPool](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ForkJoinPool.html)s. 

Fibers are not meant to replace threads in all circumstances. A fiber should be used when its body (the code it executes) blocks very often waiting on other fibers (e.g. waiting for messages sent by other fibers on a channel, or waiting for the value of a dataflow-variable). For long-running computations that rarely block, traditional threads are preferable. Fortunately, as we shall see, fibers and threads interoperate very well.


advantages, asynchronous

### Using Fibers

A fiber is represented by the [`Fiber`]({{javadoc}}/fibers/Fiber.html) class. Similarly to a thread, you spawn a fiber like so:

~~~ java
new Fiber<V>() {
	@Override
	protected V run() throws SuspendExecution, InterruptedException {
        // your code
    }
}.start();
~~~

There are several differences between this and starting a thread. First, a fiber can have a return value of the generic type `V` (we'll shortly see how to use it). If your fiber does not need to return a value, use `Void` as the type for `V`, and return `null` from the `run` method. Second, the `run` method is allowed to throw an `InterruptedException`, (this is mostly a matter of convenience), as well as `SuspendExecution` which we'll come back to.

You can also start a fiber by passing an instance of [`SuspendableRunnable`]({{javadoc}}/strands/SuspendableRunnable.html) or [`SuspendableCallable`]({{javadoc}}/strands/SuspendableCallable.html) to `Fiber`'s constructor:

~~~ java
new Fiber<Void>(new SuspendableRunnable() {
	public void run() throws SuspendExecution, InterruptedException {
		// your code
	}
}).start();
~~~

You can join a fiber much as you'd do a thread with the `join` method. To obtain the value returned by the fiber (if any), you call the `get` method, which joins the fiber and returns its result.

Other than `Fiber`'s constructor and `start` method, and possibly the `join` and `get` methods, you will not access the `Fiber` class directly much. To perform operations you would normally want to do on a thread, it is better to use the `Strand` class (discussed later), which is a generalizations of both threads and fibers.

### Suspendable This, Suspendable That

The `run` method in `Fiber`, `SuspendableRunnable` and `SuspendableCallable` declares that it may throw a `SuspendExecution` exception. This is not a real exception, but part of the inner working of fibers. Any method that may run in a fiber and may block, declares to throw this exception or is annotated with the `@Suspendable` annotation. Such a method is called a *suspendable method*. When a method you write calls a suspendable method, it, too, is a suspendable method, and must therefore declare to throw `SuspendExecution` (if you cannot add this exception to your method's `throws` clause, say, because you're implementing an interface that does not throw it, you can annotate your method with the `@Suspendable` annotation, but this requires extra consideration; please see the [Advanced Fiber Usage](#advanced-fibers) section). Adding `SuspendExecution` to the `throws` clause is convenient because it makes the compiler force you to add the exception to any method that calls your method, which you should.

## Strands

A *strand* (represented by the [`Strand`]({{javadoc}}/strands/Strand.html) class) is an abstraction for both fibers and threads; in short – a strand is either a fiber or a thread. The `Strand` class provides many useful methods. `Strand.currentStrand()` returns the current running strand (be it a fiber or a thread); `Strand.sleep()` suspends the current strand for the given number of milliseconds; `getStackTrace` returns the current stack trace of the strand. To learn more about what operations you can perform on strands, please consult the [Javadoc]({{javadoc}}/strands/Strand.html).

### `park` and `unpark`

Most importantly (though relevant only for power-users who would like to implement their own concurrency primitives, such as locks), the `Strand` classcontains the methods `park` and `unpark`, that delegate to `Fiber.park` and `Fiber.unpark` methods if the strand is a fiber, or to [`LockSupport`](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/LockSupport.html)'s `park` and `unpark` methods if the strand is a thread (`LockSupport` lies at the core of all `java.util.concurrent` classes). This allows to create synchronization mechanisms that work well for both fibers and threads.
