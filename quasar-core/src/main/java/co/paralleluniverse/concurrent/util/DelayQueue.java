/**
 * An unbounded {@linkplain BlockingQueue blocking queue} of
 * <tt>Delayed</tt> elements, in which an element can only be taken
 * when its delay has expired. The <em>head</em> of the queue is that
 * <tt>Delayed</tt> element whose delay expired furthest in the
 * past. If no delay has expired there is no head and <tt>poll</tt>
 * will return <tt>null</tt>. Expiration occurs when an element's
 * <tt>getDelay(TimeUnit.NANOSECONDS)</tt> method returns a value less
 * than or equal to zero. Even though unexpired elements cannot be
 * removed using <tt>take</tt> or <tt>poll</tt>, they are otherwise
 * treated as normal elements. For example, the <tt>size</tt> method
 * returns the count of both expired and unexpired elements.
 * This queue does not permit null elements.
 *
 * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
 * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link
 * Iterator} interfaces.
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.
