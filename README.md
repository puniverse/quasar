# Quasar: lightweight threads and actors for the JVM.

Currently, there isn’t much in the way of documentation (coming soon!).
In the meantime, you can study the examples [here](https://github.com/puniverse/quasar/tree/master/src/test/java/co/paralleluniverse/actors).

You can also read the introductory [blog post](http://blog.paralleluniverse.co).

## Getting started

In Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>co.paralleluniverse</groupId>
    <artifactId>quasar</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Or, build from sources by running:

```
./gradlew
```
